Learning programming from scratch can be a daunting task. Fortunately, there are many resources that can help you get started!

### Learn to Code
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) offers free and paid interactive lessons for a variety of languages and topics
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is, well, very free. It focuses on web development and python. They also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/freecodecamp). It's considered by many to be too easy but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is another one for if you want to learn how to make websites. It's considered better than freeCodeCamp but also requires more committment.
- [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) is a computer science course at Harvard with all of its course material online for free. It's considered by many to be *the* computer science class for beginners. Seriously, the professor is entertaining and clear, it's free, it starts from scratch (pun intended), what more could you ask for?
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) has very thorough written guides on everything. They're very nice to use as a reference.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is another useful reference
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing) has lessons on how to code too! 
- [Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/home) is a great resource for if you want to learn a specific language. Marcus, the previous president, recommended going through Sololearn for basics then moving on to introductory problems on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [edX](https://www.edx.org/) is just great and you can find everything on it

Note that this is not a comprehensive list by any means. 

If you're really indecisive, just do CS50 for an overview of cs, The Odin Project for web development, Sololearn + Hackerrank for a specific language, and edX for anything else.
