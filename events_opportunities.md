**More Info**:
The GHSCC is a fantastic opportunity for students who want to challenge themselves to succeed in their learning ventures. No previous experience needed, only an Internet connection and computer!

Teams of up to three high school students are invited to participate in a round of challenges designed to test their knowledge of cybersecurity, computer science and information technology.

Compete with high schools around the state of Michigan to claim a spot in the top three winners, take home unique prizes, and qualify for a cybersecurity certification.

Best of all, it's entirely free!
