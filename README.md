## Issues

There aren't any glaring functionality issues but
- The google calendar isn't mobile friendly (should be put in a responsive iframe)
  - Alternatively, replace/remove the google calendar
- The google calendar is ugly
- The fonts are kinda ugly too
- I tried to make the nav-bar text semi-transparent and become solid white when you hover on one. The exact opposite happened. It looks pretty cool though so it's not really an issue
- ~~The titles are too big~~ Done
- ~~Google SEO optimization~~ Done
