Pihi Compsci is a computer science oriented club at Pioneer High School where students mess around with code, go to coding competitions, and have fun. Anyone with an interest in programming is encouraged to join, and no experience is required.

One of the main focuses of the club is competitive programming, which is a mind sport where participants write programs to solve problems and are judged off of factors such as how long the program takes to run, how quickly you finish, and how much memory the program takes. Pioneer has historically had success at programming competitions like this as can be seen [here](https://news.a2schools.org/pioneer-high-school-coding-team-excels-at-recent-competitions/) and [here](https://news.a2schools.org/pioneer-students-shine-at-computer-science-competition/). We **_CRUSHED_** the competiton at MSU last year too, but the details slipped away. Blame covid. 

While we have traditionally focused on competitive programming, we're open to new ideas! Feel free to [contact us](mailto:s.sophi.w@gmail.com) with any suggestions or requests.

Note: make a contact us page... maybe. I mean, email works fine and why fix something that already works?


## Syntax Highlighting Test
**Test** _test_ ~~test~~ ||test|| `test` 
> test

```python
def test1():
  print("test")

class Test:
  def __init__(self, thing):
    self.thing = thing

  def testyTest(self, tessst):
    return test

test_test = Test(t)
test.thing
test.testyTest()
test1()
```
